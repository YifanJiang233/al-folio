#### Abstract

In this talk, instead of considering the pathwise property of the entropy solution of a scalar conservation law, we are interested in the (probability) law of the solution.
In 2010, Menon and Srinivasan conjectured that a certain class (spectrally negative) of Markov processes (in $$x$$) is preserved by the entropy solution and proposed the evolution (in $$t$$) of the generator of the solution.
Bertoin and Sinai characterized Burgers' equation with Brownian initial data; Rezakhanlou and Kaspar verified this conjecture for bounded spectrally negative LÃ©vy processes for general scalar conservation laws.
We will discuss their proofs and show how probability theory intertwines with nonlinear PDEs.
