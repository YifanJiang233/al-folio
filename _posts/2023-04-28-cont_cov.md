We start with Kolmogorov continuity theorem which lies in the central of the continuous martingale theory.

<div class="thm" text="Kolmogorov">
    Let \(\{X_{t}\}_{t\geq 0}\) be a real-valued stochastic process such that there exist \(\alpha, \beta , K\) satisfying
    \begin{equation*}
        \E \bigl[|X_{t}-X_{s}|^{\alpha}\bigr]\leq K |t-s|^{1+\beta},
    \end{equation*}
    for any  \(t,s\geq 0\).
    Then \(X\) has a \(\gamma\)–Hölder continuous modification for any  \(0 <\gamma <\beta/\alpha \).
</div>
By noticing the ultracontractivity of Gaussion measures,  we immediately derive that fractional Brownian motion $ B^{H} $ has a $\gamma$–Hölder modification where $0< \gamma < H$.
More generally, we can show for any centered random Gaussian field $\\{X(x)\\}_{x\in\mathbb{R}^{d}}$  with covariance $C$ has a $\gamma$–Hölder modification where $0< \gamma < H$ if
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq-C}
    C(x,x)+C(y,y)-2C(x,y)\leq K|x-y|^{2H}.
\end{equation}
Here, $C$ is given by $C(x,y)=\E[X(x)X(y)]$.
This, of course, implies the continuity of $C$.
But, can we circumvent using Kolmogorov theorem?

<div class="prop">
    Let \(C:\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}\) be symmetric, locally bounded, and positive definite in the sense that for any finite collection \(\{x_{i}\}_{i=1}^{m}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^{d}\), the martix \(M_{ij}=C(x_{i},x_{j})\) is positive definite.
    Then \eqref{eq-C} implies the jointly continuity of \(C\).
</div>

<div class="proof">
 By assmuption we take positive definite matrix
\begin{equation*} M= \begin{pmatrix} C(y,y) &C(y,x_{1}) & C(y,x_{2}) \\ C(x_{1},y)&C(x_{1},x_{1})  & C(x_{1},x_{2})  \\   C(x_{2},y)& C(x_{2},x_{1}) & C(x_{2},x_{2})
\end{pmatrix}\end{equation*}
and vecter \begin{equation*} \alpha =\begin{pmatrix} C(x_{1},x_{1})+C(x_{2},x_{2})-2C(x_{1},x_{2}) \\ C(x_{2},y)-C(x_{1},y)\\ C(x_{1},y)-C(x_{2},y)\end{pmatrix}.\end{equation*}
Then we notice $\alpha^{\intercal} M\alpha \geq 0$ is equivalent to
 \begin{equation*}
 [C(x_1,y)-C(x_2,y)]^2 \leq 4 C(y,y)[C(x_{1},x_{1})+C(x_{2},x_{2})-2C(x_{1},x_{2})].
 \end{equation*}
By triangle inequality we conclude the proof.
