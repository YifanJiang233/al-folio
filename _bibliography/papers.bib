  abstract = {We propose a transfer principle to study the adapted 2-Wasserstein distance between stochastic processes. First, we obtain an explicit formula for the distance between real-valued mean-square continuous Gaussian processes by introducing the causal factorization as an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Cholesky decomposition for operators on Hilbert spaces. We discuss the existence and uniqueness of this causal factorization and link it to the canonical representation of Gaussian processes. As a byproduct, we characterize mean-square continuous Gaussian Volterra processes in terms of their natural filtrations. Moreover, for real-valued fractional stochastic differential equations, we show that the synchronous coupling between the driving fractional noises attains the adapted Wasserstein distance under some monotonicity conditions. Our results cover a wide class of stochastic processes which are neither Markov processes nor semi-martingales, including fractional Brownian motions and fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck processes.},

  abstract = {Design of adversarial attacks for deep neural networks, as well as methods of adversarial training against them, are subject of intense research. In this paper, we propose methods to train against distributional attack threats, extending the TRADES method used for pointwise attacks. Our approach leverages recent contributions and relies on sensitivity analysis for Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization problems. We introduce an efficient fine-tuning method which can be deployed on a previously trained model. We test our methods on a range of pre-trained models on RobustBench. These experimental results demonstrate the additional training enhances Wasserstein distributional robustness, while maintaining original levels of pointwise robustness, even for already very successful networks. The improvements are less marked for models pre-trained using huge synthetic datasets of 20-100M images. However, remarkably, sometimes our methods are still able to improve their performance even when trained using only the original training dataset (50k images).},

  abstract ={We study the causal distributionally robust optimization (DRO) in both discrete- and continuous- time settings. The framework captures model uncertainty, with potential models penalized in function of their adapted Wasserstein distance to a given reference model. Strength of the penalty is controlled using a real-valued parameter which, in the special case of an indicator penalty, is simply the radius of the uncertainty ball. Our main results derive the first-order sensitivity of the value of causal DRO with respect to the penalization parameter, i.e., we compute the sensitivity to model uncertainty. Moreover, we investigate the case where a martingale constraint is imposed on the underlying model, as is the case for pricing measures in mathematical finance. We introduce different scaling regimes, which allow us to obtain the continuous-time sensitivities as nontrivial limits of their discrete-time counterparts. We illustrate our results with examples. The sensitivities are naturally expressed using optional projections of Malliavin derivatives. To establish our results we obtain several novel results which are of independent interest. In particular, we introduce pathwise Malliavin derivatives and show these extend the classical notion. We also establish a novel stochastic Fubini theorem.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the stochastic optimization problem from a continuous-time perspective. We propose a stochastic first-order algorithm, called Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM), and show that the trajectory of SGDM, despite its stochastic nature, converges to a deterministic second-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in \(L_{2}\)-norm, as the stepsize goes to zero. The connection between the ODE and the algorithm results in delightful patterns in the discrete-time convergence analysis. More specifically, we develop convergence results for the ODE through a Lyapunov function, and translate the whole argument to the discrete-time case. This approach yields a novel anytime convergence guarantee for stochastic gradient methods. Precisely, we prove that, for any \(\beta\), there exists \(k_{0}\) such that the sequence \(\{x_{k}\}\) governed by running SGDM on a smooth convex function \(f\) satisfies
  \[ 
    \bbP\Biggl(\mathop{\bigcap}_\{k=k_0\}^\infty \biggl\\{f (x_k) - f^* \leq  \frac\{C\log k \log(2/\beta)\}\{\sqrt\{k\}\}\biggr\\}\Biggr)\geq 1-\beta,\]
where \(f^*=\min_\{x\in\bbR^n\}f(x)\). Our contribution is significant in that it better captures the convergence behavior across the entire trajectory of the algorithm, rather than at a single iterate.},

  abstract    = {Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks (AA). For an image recognition task, this means that a small perturbation of the original can result in the image being misclassified. Design of such attacks as well as methods of adversarial training against them are subject of intense research. We re-cast the problem using techniques of Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and obtain novel contributions leveraging recent insights from DRO sensitivity analysis. We consider a set of distributional threat models. Unlike the traditional pointwise attacks, which assume a uniform bound on perturbation of each input data point, distributional threat models allow attackers to perturb inputs in a non-uniform way. We link these more general attacks with questions of out-of-sample performance and Knightian uncertainty. To evaluate the distributional robustness of neural networks, we propose a first-order AA algorithm and its multistep version. Our attack algorithms include Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) as special cases. Furthermore, we provide a new asymptotic estimate of the adversarial accuracy against distributional threat models. The bound is fast to compute and first-order accurate, offering new insights even for the pointwise AA. It also naturally yields out-of-sample performance guarantees. We conduct numerical experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet datasets using DNNs on RobustBench to illustrate our theoretical results.
