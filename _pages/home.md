Hi, all!

I am Yifan Jiang (蒋亦凡), a third-year student in the Mathematics of Random Systems CDT.
Before coming to Oxford, I studied as an undergraduate in Mathematics at Fudan University.
I have a broad interest in stochastic analysis and its applications in finance and machine learning.

It is my honor to be supervised by Professor Jan Obłój and Professor Gui-Qiang Chen.
My DPhil research is focused on a causal transport--type distributionally robust optimization in dynamic context.
